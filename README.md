### Go solutions for leetcode

This project contains code from the Leetcode golang initiative. Trying to solve
leetcode problems simultaneously rewriting and porting a part of the python std
library without (sigh...) generics.
Largely hindered by the executive leetcode desicion to not update golang runtime
from 1.17 at the moment (feature request submitted).
